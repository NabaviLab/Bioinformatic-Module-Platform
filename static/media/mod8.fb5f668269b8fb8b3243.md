# Module Outline
## Learning Objectives
1. Learn about the various applications of Bioinformatics.
# 1. Introduction
- Bioinformatics can be applied in numerous sectors since it is such a vast field of study.
# 2. Bioinformatics in Medicine
https://aimst.edu.my/event-news/what-bioinformatics-how-used-medicine/#:~:text=Applications of bioinformatics in medicine,preventative medicine and gene therapy.
### Drug Discovery
- infectious diseases — COVID19, MonkeyPox
- developing cures using bioinformatics for a more rational and structure-based drug design
    - successful and more reliable drug design process + reduced time and cost of drug development
    - based on molecular modeling and simulation
Personalized Medicine
- medicine to tailor each person’s genetic make-up
- can predict susceptibility to certain diseases, provide proper meds, and proper dosage
- bioinformatics analyzes data from genome sequencing/ microarray gene expression analysis in -search of mutations or gene variants that could affect drug response / can improve disease treatment

### Preventive Medicine
- medicine in populations/communities
    - research methods in biostatistics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology to understand patterns and causes of health and disease
    - can create programs to prevent diseases
- identifying diseases at an early stage/ predicting disease is done through bioinformatics tools to analyze genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data for possible disease biomarkers

### Gene Therapy
- method of replacing defective genes w a functional one in the cells of a patient

### Antibiotic Resistance
- Antibiotics used to manage infectious diseases


    - Emergence of resistant strains of bacteria

- pest control
- crop patterns

# 5. Biotechnology
### What is Biotechnology?
- using scientific methods with organisms to produce new products or new forms of organisms
### GMO vs. GEO
- GMO — genetically modified organisms
- GEO — genetically enhanced organisms
    - both alter natural genetic material of the organism
### What are the Areas of Biotechnology?
- organismic
- molecular

### Important Figures
- Rosalind Elsie Franklin
    - research led to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA
- James Watson and Francis Crick
    - discovered DNA
- Mary-Claire King
    - mapped human genes for research of cancer treatments

# 6. Gene Editing
