# Module Outline
## Learning Objectives
1. To understand the ethical principles that bioinformaticians face.


2. Understand the overlap of bioethics and computer ethics in bioinformatics.

# 1. Introduction
### Medical Ethics of Hippocrates
- Hippocrates is traditionally regarded as the father of medicine
- Hippocratic Oath: an oath of ethics that health professionals must oblige by in which ethical and professional medicinal practice is emphasized.
- Since the creation of the Hippocratic Oath in 400 BCE, new additions and updates have been added, and entirely new documents have been created in order to heed to societal shifts in ethics.
- As technology advances and humans change, ethical standards evolve with them.

### Why is considering ethics in bioinformatics important?
According to the AMA Journal of Ethics, “although it is already clear that informatics is profoundly reshaping the health professions, we are only beginning to come to terms with the extraordinary risks and potential benefits of progress in the human genome sciences” (https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/toward-striking-balance-bioinformatics/2001-03)
- As the number of machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence applications in bioinformatics continues to increase, principles of artificial intelligence ethics become more important for bioinformaticians.

- Bioinformatics entails the two powerful technologies of bioethics and computer ethics. It uses the power of information technology and biological processes to solve problems posed by biotechnology and biomedicine.

### Bioethics
- **Bioethics** is a discipline that applies abstract normative principles to particular biomedical contexts (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7950205/)
- The term was first coined by Sargent Shriver in 1970 out of need for philosophical reflection on the problems presented by modern medicine.

#### Four primary principles of traditional bioethics:
1. *nonmaleficence* — there is a duty not to cause harm (Greek physician Hippocrates in 5th Century BCE)
- withhold information of uncertain significance or if no current treatment exists.
2. *beneficence* — ethical desirability or ideal of benefitting people
- communicate all information regarding one’s diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and general health.
3. *justice* — fairness and equality
- laws against discrimination
- practice of disclosing conflicts of interest
4. *autonomy* — ideal of respecting people’s choices regarding their own life and actions

###Computer Ethics
According to James H. Moor, a renowned figure in the computer science field for his philosophical contributions, he states that computer ethics is a dynamic and complex field of study which considers relationships among facts, conceptualizations, policies, and values with regard to constantly changing computer technology. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265046932_Ethics_of_Bioinformatics_Ethics_of_Bioinformatics_Ethics_of_Bioinformatics_Ethics_of_Bioinformatics_Ethics_of_Bioinformatics_A_Convergence_between_Bioethics_A_Convergence_between_Bioethics_A_Convergen)
Moor also stated that the computer has had an impact on society like no other recent technology, and it impacts almost every sector of our lives.
This requires us to rethink many of our policies, laws, and behaviors.

### The Computer Ethics Institute’s ten commandments of computer ethics:
1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.


2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people’s computer work.


3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.


4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.


5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.


6. Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid.


7. Thou shalt not use other people’s computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.


8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people’s intellectual output.


9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.


10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.

# 2. Appropriate Uses & Users
- In terms of societal benefits, large genomic databases and datasets have valuable information to diagnose and treat diseases
    - However, our genetic code carries sensitive information that could be used for capitalistic gain in the pharmaceutical industry and insurance agencies. Capitalist interests neglect the proper treatments and diagnoses for all communities.

### Consent
- Documenting patient data, but using that data to predict other future diseases
    - Patients could experience heightened anxiety in regards to future clinical manifestations that may or may not occur. This additional information that doctors could discover with bioinformatics could threaten a patient’s mental health if they do not want to know such information.
### Replacing Professionals with Computers

***DISCUSSION ACTIVITY***: Although computer systems can improve patient care, is it appropriate to train a computer to perform tasks that a working professional does not have competence in?
- Would it be appropriate to let a machine determine a patient’s treatment without a trained professional’s medical and scientific understanding?

## 3. Privacy & Confidentiality
### Intro to privacy & confidentiality
- If all of our genetic codes were stored in a bioinformatics database and if this database is breached by a hacker that broke through the firewall, then our genetic code could potentially fall into the hands of those with malicious intent.


    - Our genetic information defines the identity of our bodies and our mental characteristics, so much more personal and unchangeable information is on the line compared to something like credit card theft.
    - Thus, sharing genomic data must be done securely.

### Open Source Software


- Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibly. This allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code wherever they want. This relies on peer review and community production.
- However, this allows bioinformatics systems to be hacked more readily and it could display personal genetic information for the public.

### Data Sharing
- Companies that you share your genomic data with could share such information with third parties and not notify the individual of this, which is a privacy concern. Though this information may further research in diagnoses and treatments, knowing where your genomic data is being used could be a concern an individual may have.
